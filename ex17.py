# study drills:
    # 1. Make script more friendly by removing features (commented out)

# mistakes made:
    # "You probably did something like this, indata =
    # open(from_file).read(), which means you donâ€™t need to then do
    # in_file.close() when you reach the end of the script. It should already be
    # closed by Python once that one line runs."
