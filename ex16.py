# mistakes made:
    # cant read if opened explicitely with 'w' write, made new dummy var.

# study drills:
    # 2. Write a script similar to the last exercise that uses read and argv to read the file you just created.
    # 3. Thereâ€™s too much repetition in this file. Rewrite with just one target.write() command instead of 6.

# helpful:
    # just doing open(filename) opens it in 'r' (read) mode by default.
